            The console is a great tool for learning Javascript, you can read all about it
            <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console" target="_blank">here</a>. It allows us direct access to the Javascript event loop so that we may execute statements in real tiem! This course will rely heavily on the console to test out new techniques and skills;
            It is expected that students will familarize themselves with how to use console (access to execute statements) befire the end of the first week of class. There are several ways to access the console.
